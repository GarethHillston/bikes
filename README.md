# Bike Sharing App
This was an Electron app thrown together in a couple days for a BookingGo hackathon, to try out an aggregator for bike rental apps. There's a bunch of competing ones, like Santander bikes and Mobike in London, which we were messing with.

We wanted to offer a way to view all the rentable bikes in your area and choose one to rent through one app, rather than having to confer between a bunch of different apps. We got as far as showing the different available bikes on a map, but purchases through the app would have required custom work on the various apps' APIs.
